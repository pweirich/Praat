# Praat
 Scripts and Resources Written in Praat

 These are scripts that I have written or worked with in some way.
 I've only included scripts in here that I contributed to or modified in some way (some more than others).
 Praat was my first introduction into the coding world, so I've borrowed heavily from other people, as indicated in the notes.
 Many of the scripts in here are the result of colleagues bringing me code that they borrowed from elsewhere and wasn't working for them.
 I helped them troubleshoot and made appropriate modifications to fit their needs.
 Helping other people fix their code was a great excuse for me to practice debugging, and it has also exposed me to different people's approaches to coding.
